THREAT ID;THREAT;DESCRIPTION
M1;Queuing access;"Illegitimate access to a system obtained by ""tailing"", electronically or physically, an authorized party"
M2;Power supply;Power failure to devices which may cause loss or corruption of processed data
M3;Flooding;Flooding of the rooms where the systems and/or storage media are located
M4;Asynchronous attack;It allows you to intercept the data exchange between application programs and the operating system in multi-tasking environments, thus allowing you to modify the final data or, in extreme cases, block the operating system itself.
M5;Trojan Horse Attack;A program with apparently useful functions but which contains code aimed at damaging or destroying the system and/or tampering with or stealing data.
M6;Computer virus attack;Code that replicates itself by joining other programs, but can run autonomously. After becoming a guest inside another program, it installs itself in memory and generally attacks the system by destroying, modifying, or stealing the data it contains.
M7;Logic bombs;Portions of code inserted into the system that, triggered by specific events, perform destructive actions
M8;Lightning strike;Destruction of the system, or some of its parts, following a lightning strike
M9;Searching through the garbage;Search through the trash for useful information on paper, disks, tapes, etc. that have been thrown away in order to gain access to the system
M10;Covert storage channel;It channels information by changing stored data, modifies file names, fills disks with useless data in order to force the system to use other resources to regain useful space.
M11;Covert timing channel;Conveys information to each temporal execution of a procedure using system timings
M12;Accidental damage to media;Unintended damage to storage media that can lead to data loss
M13;Destruction of the CED area;Severe damage to equipment and stored data due to explosions, vandalism, natural disasters, etc.
M14;Accidental error;Unwanted error caused by ignorance of the operating rules or by particular environmental conditions relating to the client components only
M15;Physical theft of media;Theft of storage media and devices containing data
M16;Fire;Fire in the premises where the systems and/or storage media are located
M17;Entering false information;Entering incorrect information into a system by personnel authorized to access it
M18;Interception and espionage;Interception of electromagnetic emissions generated by electrical cables or monitors. Those who carry out espionage often do not know when useful information may transit, so they must collect large amounts of data and then search for items of interest
M19;Electromagnetic interference;Interference to hardware devices caused by electric or magnetic fields
M20;Service interruption;Techniques used to stress the response capabilities of a system in order to inhibit the correct functioning of its services to users
M21;Masking;Subject who provides a false identity (fis.log.) to the system in order to gain access
M22;Hidden access doors;Access to the heart of the system left by the programmers who created the software
M23;Unconditional access procedure;program, used by system administrators/network administrators to recover a system from a software or hardware failure and regain access, that bypasses all system protections
M24;Playback Retransmission;Technique that uses hardware or software to record legitimate input from a user and retransmit it to both the system and the attacker
M25;Sabotage;Interruption/modification of the operation of hardware/software devices which may lead to loss of confidentiality/integrity/availability of data
M26;Unnoticed data theft;Collection of information, even in small quantities, in a way that goes unnoticed
M27;Violation of login procedures;Using software applications designed specifically, or through repeated attempts, to allow an unauthorized individual to gain access to the system
M28;Network worm;program that can run autonomously and propagate over a network by automatically identifying nodes and servers. It generally does not destroy stored information, but rather reduces the efficiency of the system by slowing it down or performing a shutdown.
